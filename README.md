<h1>Discord Small Text Accessibility Theme/Plugin</h1>
<h2>What does this do?</h2>
<p>
  It's exactly what it says on the tin!
  Small text (made by starting a message with '-# ') is now normal sized, but still a little greyer.

<h2>How do I apply this?</h2>
<p>
  Using a BetterDiscord/Vencord/Other Discord Client with theme compatiblity, drag the css file into your themes folder and toggle it on!
</p>
<h2>Additional Note</h2>
<p>
  I'm pretty new to making these sorts of things, so if anyone is aware of a better implementation of this feature or there's something I missed in terms of compatibilty do let me know!
